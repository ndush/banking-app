# Payd Banking App Prototype

### Name:
Damaris Muange

### ðŸ›  Track:
Frontend

###  Target Audience:
Freelancers in Kenya (e.g. Upwork, Fiverr) â€” to manage earnings and make local transactions easily.

###  Tech Stack:
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- localStorage for mock data/state

###  Features:
- Signup / Login (mocked)
- Wallet overview (balance, recent transactions)
- Send / Receive money (mocked)
- Clear navigation and clean UI
- State managed via localStorage

###  Setup Instructions:
git clone https://github.com/ndush/banking-app.git
cd banking-app
npm install
npm run dev

### Product Thinking:
I focused on helping Kenyan freelancers easily simulate a banking experience without relying on a backend. The idea was to streamline their wallet, track balance changes, and practice flows theyâ€™re familiar with like deposits and transfers, but in a simplified prototype.
